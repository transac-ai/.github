# Transac AI

Transac AI project is geared towards generation of **enriched summaries and insights** from complex transactional data in real-time or batch using **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Imagine fine-tuned LLMs serving as a specialists working several times more efficiently than multiple human analysts, and capable of analyzing hundreds of transactions per second to generate insights and ensure compliance, risk management, and fraud detection; all in real-time. This is the power of **Transac AI**.

Transac AI is built using a highly scalable, available, and reliable [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)-based **distributed** **microservices** & **event-driven architecture**. This is enabled through the use of **low-latency** and **high-throughput** inter-connections between services using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Connect RPC](https://connectrpc.com/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

Transac AI focuses on delivering human-centric analysis that is easier to understand and act upon, eliminating the need for multiple complex data processing steps to derive insights from raw transactional data in real-time and in natural language.

## Features

Some of the core features of Transac AI include:

- **Real-time Insights Generation**: Transac AI is capable of generating insights from transactional data in real-time.
- **Scalable**: Transac AI is built using a highly scalable, available, and reliable Kubernetes-based distributed microservices & event-driven architecture.
- **Generative AI**: Transac AI uses Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate insights from transactional data in natural language.
- **Low-latency and High-throughput**: Transac AI uses low-latency and high-throughput interconnections between services using gRPC, Apache Kafka, Connect RPC, and GraphQL.
- **Automated Compliance, Risk Management, and Fraud Detection**: Transac AI can be used to automate compliance, risk management, and fraud detection tasks using sophisticated prompts and fine-tuned LLMs.
